# Prompt: Create Google Slides for Week 1 - "What's Possible with AI?"

## Context

Create a 19-slide Google Slides presentation for a 2-hour class teaching grades 7-11 students about AI. This is the first session of a 12-week program called "Youth Horizons AI Researcher Program."

**Audience:** High-achieving middle and high school students (ages 12-17)
**Tone:** Educational, clear, direct. Not silly or overly playful—these are smart students who want real information.
**Style:** Clean, modern, readable. Use consistent fonts and colors throughout.

I will provide images separately for slides that need them. Leave placeholder space for images where indicated.

## Slide-by-Slide Instructions

### Slide 1 — Title Slide
**Title:** What's Possible with AI?
**Subtitle:** Explore, Discover, Get Inspired
**Footer:** Youth Horizons AI Researcher Program • Week 1

*No image needed*

---

### Slide 2 — Today's Roadmap
**Title:** Today's Roadmap

**Content:** Create a visual agenda with times. Use icons or a simple timeline layout:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0:00–0:15 | What is AI? |
| 0:15–0:45 | Explore Image AI together |
| 0:45–1:00 | Discussion: How does it work? |
| 1:00–1:30 | Independent exploration |
| 1:30–1:45 | Account setup |
| 1:45–2:00 | Share & reflect |

*No image needed—the schedule itself is the visual*

### Slide 3 — The Big Secret
**Title:** The Big Secret

**Main text (large, centered):** "AI isn't magic."

**Below:** Every AI tool follows the same basic pattern:

```
INPUT  →  [AI MODEL]  →  OUTPUT
```

**Image:** I will provide a diagram showing this pattern (slide-03-input-model-output.png)
- Place the image prominently in the center-bottom of the slide

---

### Slide 4 — Examples of the Pattern
**Title:** The Pattern in Action

**Content:** Show four examples of INPUT → MODEL → OUTPUT:

1. **Text → ChatGPT → Text**
   "What's the weather?" → [ChatGPT] → "Sunny and 72°F"

2. **Text → DALL-E → Image**
   "A castle in the clouds" → [DALL-E] → [generated image]

3. **Audio → Whisper → Text**
   [speech audio] → [Whisper] → "Hello, how are you?"

4. **Image → Classifier → Labels**
   [photo of cat] → [Classifier] → "Cat: 94%"

**Key point at bottom:** Every AI tool follows this same structure.

**Image:** I will provide a diagram showing these four examples (slide-04-examples.png)

---

### Slide 5 — Discussion Question
**Title:** Discussion Question

**Main text (large, centered):**
"What's something you think AI probably CAN'T do well?"

**Smaller text below:**
We'll revisit this at the end of class.

*No image needed—let the question stand alone*

---

### Slide 6 — Let's Explore: Image Generation
**Title:** Let's Explore: Image Generation

**Main text:**
We'll try this together.

**Large clickable link:**
🔗 **Stable Diffusion 3.5**
https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large

*No image needed—the link is the focus*

---

### Slide 7 — Experiment 1: Adding Detail
**Title:** Experiment 1: Adding Detail

**Content:** Three prompts to try:

1. `a cat`
2. `a fluffy orange cat sitting on a windowsill`
3. `a fluffy orange cat sitting on a windowsill, golden hour lighting, photograph`

**Question at bottom:**
How does adding detail change the result?

**Image:** I will provide a diagram showing how detail narrows possibilities (slide-07-detail-funnel.png)

---

### Slide 8 — Experiment 2: Style Matters
**Title:** Experiment 2: Style Matters

**Content:** Same subject, different styles:

- `a robot, photograph`
- `a robot, oil painting, renaissance style`
- `a robot, anime style`
- `a robot, pencil sketch`

**Key point:** Style words tell the model which patterns to use.

**Image:** I will provide a diagram showing style branching (slide-08-style-branches.png)

---

### Slide 9 — Experiment 3: Breaking It
**Title:** Experiment 3: Breaking It

**Content:** Try to confuse the AI:

- **Contradictions:** `a square circle`
- **Abstract concepts:** `the feeling of Monday morning`
- **Specific text:** `a sign that says HELLO WORLD`
- **Hands:** `a person waving with five fingers`

**Question:** What fails? Why?

**Image:** I will provide a diagram explaining why AI struggles with these (slide-09-failure-modes.png)

---

### Slide 10 — Image Understanding
**Title:** Now the Other Direction: Image Understanding

**Main text:**
AI that LOOKS at images instead of creating them.

**Large clickable link:**
🔗 **Florence-2**
https://huggingface.co/spaces/gokaygokay/Florence-2

**Tasks to try:**
- Caption vs. Detailed Caption
- Object Detection

**Instruction:** Upload your own photo!

*No image needed*

---

### Slide 11 — Discussion Questions
**Title:** Let's Figure This Out

**Three questions:**

1. **Why does more detail = better results?**

2. **Why does AI struggle with hands and text in images?**

3. **Can AI understand WHY a photo is funny?**
   - The emotional meaning?
   - What happened before or after?

*No image needed—discussion slide*

---

### Slide 12 — The Key Insight
**Title:** The Key Insight

**Image:** I will provide a diagram comparing Human Understanding vs AI Pattern Matching (slide-12-understanding-gap.png)
- This image should be large and prominent—it's the conceptual centerpiece

**Text below image:**
"The Understanding Gap"

---

### Slide 13 — Remember This
**Title:** Remember This

**Three key points (use large text, stacked):**

1. AI = incredibly talented mimics

2. They reproduce patterns they've seen

3. They don't know what those patterns *mean*

**Image:** I will provide a diagram showing training vs. inference (slide-13-training-inference.png)

---

### Slide 14 — Your Mission
**Title:** Your Mission: Independent Exploration

**Content:**

✓ Visit at least **6 different AI tools**

✓ Spend **3-4 minutes** with each

✓ Find their **limits**—what breaks them?

✓ **Rate and take notes**

**Instruction at bottom:**
→ Open your notebook for the tool list and note-taking tables

*No image needed*

---

### Slide 15 — The Categories
**Title:** AI Tool Categories

**Image:** I will provide a taxonomy diagram showing the AI landscape (slide-15-categories.png)
- This should be the main focus of the slide

**Four categories shown:**
- Text & Language
- Audio & Speech
- Images
- Multimodal / Wild Cards

---

### Slide 16 — GitHub Setup
**Title:** GitHub: Your Portfolio Home

**Logo:** Include GitHub's Octocat logo if possible

**Link:**
🔗 **github.com**

**Key points:**
- Choose your username carefully—it's permanent!
- Good: `maya-builds`, `alex-ai`, `sam-codes`
- Avoid: birth years, gamertags, inside jokes

**Instruction:**
→ Follow detailed steps in your notebook

*No custom image needed—use GitHub logo*

---

### Slide 17 — Hugging Face Setup
**Title:** Hugging Face: Home of AI Models

**Logo:** Include Hugging Face logo (yellow emoji face) if possible

**Link:**
🔗 **huggingface.co**

**Key point:**
You'll use this constantly throughout the program.

**Instruction:**
→ Follow steps in your notebook

*No custom image needed—use Hugging Face logo*

---

### Slide 18 — Share & Reflect
**Title:** Share & Reflect

**Content:**

**Each person shares:**
- ONE tool that impressed or surprised you
- ONE thing AI couldn't do that you tried

**Then:**
→ Complete reflection questions in your notebook

*No image needed*

### Slide 19 — Next Week Preview
**Title:** Next Week: You'll Write Code

**Main text:**
You'll run AI models yourself—and it's easier than you think.

**Code block (use monospace font):**
```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
classifier("I love learning about AI!")
```

**Below code:**
Three lines. That's it.

**Closing:** See you next week!

**Image:** I will provide a diagram breaking down what this code does (slide-19-pipeline-code.png)

---

## Design Guidelines

1. **Fonts:** Use a clean sans-serif font (e.g., Google Sans, Roboto, or Open Sans)
2. **Colors:** Stick to 2-3 colors consistently. Suggested palette:
   - Primary: Dark blue or black for text
   - Accent: A bright color (blue, teal, or orange) for emphasis
   - Background: White or very light gray
3. **Code blocks:** Use monospace font with a light gray background
4. **Links:** Make them visually prominent and obviously clickable
5. **Consistency:** Same layout patterns for similar slide types (e.g., all "Experiment" slides should look similar)
