    "**Artificial Intelligence** = computers that can do things we usually think require human intelligence.\n",

    "But here's the secret: **AI isn't magic.** Every AI tool follows the same basic pattern:\n",

    "INPUT  -->  [AI MODEL]  -->  OUTPUT\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on your experiments, let's figure some things out together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1:** Why does adding more detail to a prompt usually give better results?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about: If I said \"draw a cat\" vs \"draw a fluffy orange tabby cat curled up on a blue velvet couch\" - which is easier for a human artist? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2:** Why does AI struggle with hands and text in images?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: These models learned from millions of images. How many images of hands vs. faces do you think exist online? And does \"A\" always look exactly the same?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3:** The image captioning AI could describe what's IN an image, but could it understand:\n",
    "- Why a photo is funny?\n",
    "- The emotional meaning of a photo?\n",
    "- What happened right before or after the photo?\n",

    "### Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
