Hi Prof. Daniel,

Thank you so much for your message — and I really appreciate your interest. You're absolutely right that without more context, it's hard to know what questions to ask, so I'm very happy to lay out the structure and expectations more clearly.

Below is a high-level overview of the Machine program and how instructors typically engage with it. I'm also happy to share more detailed documents or walk through everything live if that's easier.

## 1. Program Structure (Big Picture)

Machine is a structured, multi-level AI curriculum for middle and high school students (roughly Grades 7–11), designed as a coherent pathway rather than standalone courses.

**Level 1 – AI Foundations & Research Mindset**
Conceptual understanding of AI, how modern systems work, how to read and evaluate AI-related research, and how to think critically about AI applications and limitations.
Domain-agnostic, discussion-driven.

**Level 2 – AI Systems & Applied Foundations**
Data, models, training, evaluation, and small applied projects using low-code or guided coding tools.
Still general-purpose, with more technical structure.

**Level 3 – Applied AI Research (Domain-Specific)**
This is where students apply AI to a specific real-world domain (e.g. medical imaging, environment, education, social data). Students complete a guided, research-style project with a strong emphasis on framing, analysis, and ethics.

**Level 4 – Capstone / Advanced Research**
A mentorship-based level for a smaller group of advanced students pursuing deeper or longer-term research projects.

Most professors we work with choose to engage primarily at Level 3 and/or Level 4, where domain expertise is most valuable.

## 2. Expectations for Instructors

Depending on the level, instructors are typically responsible for:

- Leading live online sessions (seminar + guided discussion / labs)
- Guiding students through structured projects or research questions
- Providing high-level feedback on student work (not heavy grading)
- Helping students think critically about results, limitations, and trade-offs

All curriculum structure, enrollment, scheduling coordination, and parent communication are handled by our team.

## 3. Class Format & Schedule

Based on current conversations with families:

- **Class size:** 5–6 students per group
- **Session length:** 2 hours
- **Frequency:** Typically once per week (exact schedules are flexible and coordinated with instructor availability)
- **Format:** Fully online (Zoom-based)

We are very flexible in shaping schedules around instructor availability, especially for Level 3 and Level 4.

## 4. Compensation (Transparency)

Our current working rates are:

| Level | Rate | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Level 1 | $150/hour | |
| Level 2 | $200/hour | |
| Level 3 | $300/hour | Reflecting domain expertise and project supervision |
| Level 4 | Custom | Mentorship arrangements usually customized |

These are starting points, and we're always open to discussion depending on scope and involvement.

## 5. Technology & Platforms

**From the instructor side:**
- Zoom for live sessions
- Google Classroom (or equivalent) for distributing materials and collecting student work
- Any domain-specific tools you prefer (we support both low-code and guided-code approaches)

**From the student side:**
- We handle enrollment, onboarding, and access setup
- Students are guided step-by-step on required tools and platforms

We aim to keep the technical overhead as light as possible for instructors.

## 6. Next Steps

If this sounds aligned with your interests, a natural next step would be:

- A short call to walk through the levels in more detail, or
- Focusing specifically on a Level 3 track that matches your background, and discussing how you might want to shape it.

I'm very happy to share additional written materials or examples as well — just let me know what would be most helpful.

Thanks again and I look forward to continuing the conversation.

Best regards,
Bing
