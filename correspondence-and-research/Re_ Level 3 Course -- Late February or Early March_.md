Hi Dr. Plate,

Thank you again for such a careful and insightful response. I really
appreciate your thoughtful analysis, especially around the technical
realities of audio and video processing — your caution there is absolutely
well-taken.

I wanted to follow up with one clarification that may help further
contextualize how we’re envisioning the role of the different modules,
particularly the delivery (audio/video) component.

Our intention is not that each module functions as a fully independent or
self-contained project. Rather, the design goal is for each student to take
primary ownership of one module, while still operating within a shared
system and a shared research narrative. We actively want there to be
“upstream” and “downstream” coordination across modules — for example, how
content analysis feeds into feedback generation, or how feedback logic
informs practice recommendations.

In that sense, the course is meant to resemble a small research-and-build
team, or even a very early-stage startup environment. Each student has a
distinct responsibility, but no one is expected to solve the entire problem
space alone. The emphasis is less on technical perfection in any single
module and more on how the modules conceptually fit together, how design
decisions interact across components, and how a partial or imperfect system
can still be evaluated and demonstrated.

With respect to the audio/video delivery module specifically, we see it as
a potentially higher-risk, higher-complexity role within the team, not a
requirement for every cohort and not something that needs to reach a high
level of technical sophistication to be successful. Even a relatively
simple or preliminary implementation — or one that clearly documents its
limitations — would be entirely acceptable if it meaningfully connects to
the broader system.

From our perspective, even arriving at a basic, imperfect, but integrated
prototype — where the four modules can be shown working together at a
conceptual or minimal functional level — would already constitute a strong
outcome. The process of grappling with integration challenges, tradeoffs,
and constraints is itself a major part of the educational value we’re
aiming for.

More broadly, I also wanted to share that we have been actively thinking
about the longer-term development of the Level 3 curriculum as a whole. We
already have another instructor working with us on advancing this track,
and if this direction resonates with you, we would very much welcome your
involvement as well.

We are completely open in terms of how such a collaboration might be
structured — whether around curriculum design, teaching, advising, or a
combination — and we would also appreciate hearing your thoughts on what a
reasonable model of collaboration and compensation might look like from
your perspective.

Thank you again for engaging with this so thoughtfully. I truly value your
perspective, and I’m excited about the possibility of building something
meaningful together, should this align with your interests and availability.

Best regards,
Bing

>
> The overarching goal is for students to conduct applied AI research by

> 2. Why “Speech & Debate Agent” is the Core Theme

> Speech & Debate is particularly well-suited as a Level 3 research theme

> • Evaluation-friendly (rubrics, judges, coaches, transcripts)

> Each Level 3 cohort consists of four students.
> • All students share:
> • The same global research theme
> • The same speech data sources (transcripts, audio, rubrics)
> • The same evaluation philosophy
> • Each student selects one research module as their primary project focus.

> Instead, the course prioritizes:
