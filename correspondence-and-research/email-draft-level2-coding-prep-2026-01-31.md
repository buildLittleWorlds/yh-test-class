## Draft 1: Short Response (Send First)

Hi Bing,

Thanks for passing this along. Before I answer in detail, it would help to know more about the current enrollment picture. What's the age range looking like so far — are we seeing more middle schoolers, high schoolers, or a mix? That'll help me tailor the response and potentially adjust pacing in the early weeks.

To give you something to share now: yes, the course involves coding, but it's designed so that no prior programming experience is required. Students will use Python in Google Colab (a free browser-based environment — nothing to install). What matters more than coding background is general comfort with technology: being willing to try unfamiliar tools, navigate new websites, and push through when something doesn't work right away. The curriculum teaches students to use AI assistants to write code *for* them, so frustration tolerance and willingness to ask for help (from me and from AI) matter more than memorizing syntax.

Let me know what the cohort is shaping up to look like, and I can provide more detail if parents want it.

Best,
Dr. Plate

## Draft 2: Detailed Follow-Up (Send If Bing Asks for More)

Hi Bing,

Here's more detail on the coding component for parents who want it.

### Programming Language

Students will work with Python, which is the standard language for AI development. However, they won't need to memorize Python syntax or write code from scratch. The course uses Hugging Face's `transformers` library, which provides simple, high-level commands for running AI models. A working AI tool can be built in as few as three lines of code.

### Prior Experience

No coding experience is required. The curriculum is designed for complete beginners.

Here's how the learning progression works:
- **Week 1:** Pure exploration — students try AI tools hands-on with no code at all
- **Week 2:** Students run pre-written code in Google Colab (a free, browser-based environment — no software installation needed)
- **Week 3 onward:** Students learn to use AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude) to *write code for them*. They describe what they want to build, the AI generates the code, and students learn to understand and modify it.

This "AI-assisted coding" approach reflects how many professional developers actually work today. Students learn to read and reason about code without needing to memorize syntax — they develop the more durable skills of knowing what to ask for and how to evaluate what they get back.

That said, I do want to reiterate what I mentioned in my earlier note: this course requires willingness to problem-solve and patience when things don't work on the first try. Students who are comfortable with some ambiguity and iteration will thrive. For younger students (G7-8), this works best with motivated, high-achieving learners.

Happy to provide more detail if parents have follow-up questions.

Best,
Dr. Plate
