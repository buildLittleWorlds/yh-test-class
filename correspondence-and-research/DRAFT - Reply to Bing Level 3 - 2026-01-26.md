Hi Bing,

Thank you for this thoughtful response. I'm genuinely excited about working together on Level 3, and I appreciate how clearly you've laid out the collaboration model. The approach you've described—YHL handling the structural framework while instructors focus on academic soundness, mentorship, and project delivery—makes a lot of sense to me and feels very workable.

To confirm: I'm fully on board with the timeline you've outlined. Mid-March for Level 3 works well on my end, and I'm looking forward to getting started.

On the technical side, I wanted to share that I've been doing some preliminary experiments with audio analysis over the past few days—specifically using Whisper for transcription and librosa for prosodic feature extraction (pace, pauses, energy, pitch). Based on what I've seen, I'm actually much more optimistic about the audio components of the Speech & Debate Agent than I initially was. The tools are mature, the output is reliable, and the technical barriers feel manageable for students at this level. Video still strikes me as considerably more complex, but audio seems quite plausible and less risky than I first thought.

One request: would it be possible to get access to any curricular materials that Youth Horizons uses when teaching debate, rhetoric, or elocution? Understanding what students learn in your existing speech and debate programs would help me contextualize the kind of work Level 3 students might want to pursue with the agent. Even outlines, rubrics, or coaching frameworks would be useful.

Looking forward to next steps.

Best,
Dan
