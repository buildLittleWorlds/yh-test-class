## What's Being Proposed

### The Big Picture

Youth Horizons Learning (YHL) runs the **"Machine" program** — a structured, multi-level AI curriculum for G7-11 students:

| Level | Theme | Format | Sessions | Rate |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|------|
| Level 1 | AI Foundations & Research Mindset | Discussion-driven | 10 | **$150/hour** |
| Level 2 | AI Systems & Applied Foundations | Hands-on coding | 12 | **$200/hour** |
| Level 3 | Applied AI Research (Domain-Specific) | Lab-style projects | 15-16 | **$300/hour** |
| Level 4 | Capstone / Advanced Research | Mentorship | Custom | **Custom** |

**Level 3 is the new offering** they're developing with you. The $300/hour rate reflects "domain expertise and project supervision."

**Level 3 for your first cohort: 15-16 sessions × 2 hours × $300/hour = $9,000–$9,600**

---

## What Is a "Module"?

This is the key concept you're asking about. In Bing's proposal, a **module** is:

### NOT a week or session of curriculum

A module is a **student research project area** — one piece of a larger collaborative system.

### The Structure

- **4 students** per Level 3 cohort
- **Each student owns 1 module** (their individual research focus)
- **All 4 modules** work together to form one integrated system (the "Speech & Debate Coach")

### The Four Proposed Modules

| Module | What the Student Investigates | Technical Complexity |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Speech Content Analysis** | Argument structure, clarity, logical completeness | Low-Medium (LLM-based, text) |
| **Speech Delivery Analysis** | Pace, pauses, emphasis, prosodic features | **High** (audio processing) |
| **Judge-Style Feedback Modeling** | Comparing AI feedback to human judge feedback | Medium (LLM-based, rubric comparison) |
| **Personalized Practice Recommendation** | AI-driven training recommendations | Medium (LLM-based, synthesis) |

### How Modules Connect

Bing's clarification in the most recent email is important:

> "Our intention is not that each module functions as a fully independent or self-contained project. Rather, the design goal is for each student to take primary ownership of one module, while still operating within a shared system and a shared research narrative."

This means:
- Content Analysis **feeds into** Feedback Generation
- Feedback logic **informs** Practice Recommendations
- Students must coordinate "upstream" and "downstream"

**Think of it like a small research team or early-stage startup**, not four independent science fair projects.

## Your Role as Proposed

Bing explicitly frames the instructor role as **"PI / Lab Lead"** (Principal Investigator), not teacher:

### What You're Expected to Do
- Guide research question refinement
- Evaluate methodological decisions
- Challenge weak assumptions
- Ensure evaluation logic is sound
- Help students articulate reasoning
- Facilitate cross-module synthesis

### What You're NOT Expected to Do
- Debug code line-by-line
- Master every technical path
- Solve implementation problems
- Deliver extended lectures

### Weekly Session Structure (2 hours)

| Part | Duration | Activity |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | 30-40 min | Shared research skill (all students together) |
| 2 | 40-50 min | Individual module check-ins (8-10 min each) |
| 3 | 20-30 min | Cross-module discussion (students critique each other) |

## How Much Involvement Is Bing Proposing?

### The Most Recent Email Opens Multiple Doors

Bing's response explicitly invites **expanded collaboration**:

> "We have been actively thinking about the longer-term development of the Level 3 curriculum as a whole. We already have another instructor working with us on advancing this track, and if this direction resonates with you, we would very much welcome your involvement as well."

> "We are completely open in terms of how such a collaboration might be structured — whether around curriculum design, teaching, advising, or a combination"

### What This Signals

1. **Teaching Level 3** - Yes, they want you to teach it
2. **Curriculum development** - They responded positively to your offer to help standardize/modularize
3. **Partnership structure** - They're asking YOU to propose what collaboration looks like
4. **Multiple instructors** - They already have another Level 3 instructor; you're being invited to join a team
5. **Compensation model** - Explicitly asking for your perspective on "reasonable model of collaboration and compensation"

### The Ball Is in Your Court

Bing is asking you to define:
- What role(s) you want (teaching only? curriculum development? advising?)
- What compensation structure makes sense to you
- How you'd like to structure the collaboration

## Key Clarifications from Latest Email

### On Technical Expectations (Your Audio Concern)

Bing explicitly acknowledged your concern about audio/video processing and lowered expectations:

> "With respect to the audio/video delivery module specifically, we see it as a potentially higher-risk, higher-complexity role within the team, not a requirement for every cohort and not something that needs to reach a high level of technical sophistication to be successful."

> "Even a relatively simple or preliminary implementation — or one that clearly documents its limitations — would be entirely acceptable"

**Translation**: The audio module can fail gracefully. It's okay if it's limited or incomplete.

### On Success Criteria

> "From our perspective, even arriving at a basic, imperfect, but integrated prototype — where the four modules can be shown working together at a conceptual or minimal functional level — would already constitute a strong outcome."

**Translation**: The goal is the learning process, not a polished product. A "good enough" demo that shows conceptual integration is success.

## Confirmed Compensation

| Level | Rate | Your Potential Earnings |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| Level 2 | $200/hour | 12 sessions × 2 hrs = **$4,800** |
| Level 3 | $300/hour | 15-16 sessions × 2 hrs = **$9,000–$9,600** |
| Level 4 | Custom | Negotiated separately |

---

## Open Questions to Resolve

Before committing, you might want clarity on:

1. ~~**Rate for Level 3**~~ — **RESOLVED: $300/hour**

2. **Prep time compensation** - The PI role requires less in-session technical work but more research guidance. Is prep time compensated?

3. **Curriculum development compensation** - If you help standardize Level 3 for future cohorts, how is that paid?

4. **Data sources** - Your original question remains: where do transcripts/recordings/rubrics come from?

5. **Student readiness** - What Level 2 experience will students have? Python/Colab proficiency?

6. **The other instructor** - Who is already working on Level 3? What's their role? Would you collaborate or work independently?

7. **IP ownership** - If you develop curriculum, who owns it?

## Recommendation

The Level 3 proposal is well-designed and plays to your strengths:
- Research mentorship over technical instruction
- Argumentation/debate domain expertise
- Curriculum development interest

The "module" framing means you're not expected to debug four students' Python code — you're expected to guide four research projects that happen to use AI tools.

The main decision point is: **Do you want to just teach, or also help build the Level 3 program systematically?** Bing is clearly interested in the latter.
