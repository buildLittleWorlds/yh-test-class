Hi Dr. Plate,

Thank you — it was great speaking with you as well. This aligns very well with what we’re looking for, and we’re excited about the fit.

Your proposed Level 2 structure sounds excellent. A 12 week curriculum with weekly 2-hour sessions works well, and I really like the idea of using a Google Colab Notebook each week as both a reference and a long-term record. The combination of guided walkthroughs, Q&A, and encouraging students to develop their own variations and build a small portfolio is exactly what we’re aiming for.

Happy to align further on learning objectives and deliverables as we refine the syllabus.

In addition, if possible, could you also share a brief bio and a professional headshot? We’d love to use them for our enrollment and promotional materials.

Best,

Bing
