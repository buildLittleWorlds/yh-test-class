# Email to Bing: Level 2 Deliverables

**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Context:** Response to Bing's question about concrete takeaways for Level 2 and Level 3 preparation

Hi Bing,

These are exactly the right questions to be asking, and I want to start by saying: I'm happy to shape Level 2 around whatever outcomes you and the parents find most valuable. What I've built so far reflects my best guess at what would serve students well, but this is absolutely adjustable. If parent feedback points toward different priorities, I'm glad to adapt the curriculum to meet those needs. So consider what follows as a starting point for conversation rather than a fixed plan.

### What Students Walk Away With

**1. A Working AI Tool They Built**

Each student creates a tool that uses AI to do something—something they had a hand in designing based on their interests. For example, a student might build a tool that detects emotions in text, or one that classifies images into categories, or one that generates story ideas.

The key point for parents: students won't just follow a tutorial. They'll make choices about what their tool does and how it works, using AI assistants (like ChatGPT) to help them write the code. The scope of the final project will depend on the student—some will build more sophisticated tools than others—but everyone will have something functional they can demonstrate.

**2. A Public Portfolio**

Students publish their work on GitHub, which is essentially a platform where programmers share and showcase their projects. Think of it like a portfolio website for coding work. This gives students something tangible they can point to later.

**3. Experience Explaining Technical Work**

In the final weeks, students present their projects with a demonstration. They practice explaining what their tool does and how they built it—skills that matter whether they continue in tech or not.

### Skills Developed

By the end, students will be able to:
- Use AI assistants to help them build things (not just consume AI, but create with it)
- Run and modify code, even without formal programming training
- Work through problems iteratively—build something, test it, improve it
- Document and explain what they made

### A Note on Expectations

I want to be honest about what's realistic. This is a 24-hour course (12 sessions × 2 hours) for students with no coding background. The curriculum uses AI assistants to do the heavy lifting on code—students tell ChatGPT what they want, it writes the code, they run it and modify it. This approach works well, but it means:

- **Projects will vary in sophistication.** A highly motivated older student might build something with multiple AI capabilities working together. A younger student might build something simpler but still functional. Both are successful outcomes.
- **Some sessions may move slower than planned.** I've built in flexibility to spend more time on foundations if needed, rather than rushing ahead.
- **Students need to be willing to problem-solve.** When something doesn't work (and it won't always work on the first try), they'll need patience and willingness to troubleshoot with my help.

For younger students (G7-8), this will work best with high-achieving, motivated learners who are comfortable with some ambiguity and willing to persist through challenges.

### Level 3 Preparation

The most valuable thing Level 2 builds, in terms of preparing for Level 3, is the habit of **self-directed project work**. By the end of Level 2, students have:

- Defined a project goal themselves
- Made decisions about how to approach it
- Gotten feedback and revised their work
- Explained their choices to others

These are exactly the habits Level 3's research structure requires. I can also add more explicit emphasis on:
- **Thinking about what "good" looks like** (How do you know if your tool works well?)
- **Documenting decisions** (Why did you choose this approach?)
- **Acknowledging limitations** (What doesn't your tool handle?)

This would make the transition to Level 3 smoother without overcomplicating Level 2.

I'm very open to adjusting based on what you're hearing from parents. Let me know what resonates and what might need to shift.

Best,
Dr. Plate
