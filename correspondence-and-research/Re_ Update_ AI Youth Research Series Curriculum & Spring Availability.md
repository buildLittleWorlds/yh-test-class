Hi Bing,

Just as a quick example of how Google Colab Notebooks can be served from Github repositories, this is an experimental profile page I have built out for testing a creative way to possibly teach AI, machine learning, and data science topics in the future. I would not vouch for these actual courses right now because they are my own experiments.

But this will show you an example if you choose to click around in the links of how Google Colab links can be used live online by any student.

My experimental Github account:

https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds


Best,

Dan

Hi Dr. Plate, Thank you — it was great speaking with you as well. This aligns very well with what we’re looking for, and we’re excited about the fit. Your proposed Level 2 structure sounds excellent. A 12 week curriculum with weekly 2-hour sessions

Hi Dr. Plate,

Thank you — it was great speaking with you as well. This aligns very well with what we’re looking for, and we’re excited about the fit.

Your proposed Level 2 structure sounds excellent. A 12 week curriculum with weekly 2-hour sessions works well, and I really like the idea of using a Google Colab Notebook each week as both a reference and a long-term record. The combination of guided walkthroughs, Q&A, and encouraging students to develop their own variations and build a small portfolio is exactly what we’re aiming for.

Happy to align further on learning objectives and deliverables as we refine the syllabus.

In addition, if possible, could you also share a brief bio and a professional headshot? We’d love to use them for our enrollment and promotional materials.

Best,

Bing

Hi Bing,

It was good to talk about the courses. This fits very well with my expertise, and I'm excited to develop work for this audience.

I would recommend 10-12 weeks for the Level 2 curriculum, with a 2-hour session each week. I would create a Google Colab Notebook each week for the students to have available to look at ahead of time if they choose and use as notes and a permanent record of the material. Then during the session, I would present how to work through the material / code in the notebook for the students; answer questions about the notebook; and then if time permits, encourage students to develop their own variations on the code that they could save as their own deliverables which could gradually become a small portfolio.

Does this match with what you want for the teaching?

Dan

When do you have time to set up a video conference with the three of us?

Hi James,

Thanks for raising these points. For this round, we’ll be running small classes of about 5–6 students, so the two-hour sessions should allow for plenty of interaction, including guided discussion and instructor-led participation rather than just lecture/demo.

This cohort will be primarily focused on North American native English-speaking students, so we’re open to scheduling the sessions on weekday evenings rather than optimizing for a global time zone this time.

Let me know if that helps address your concerns, or if you’d like to suggest a time window that works best on your end.

Best,
Bing

Bing,

How would you like the two-hour sessions to be organized? If this will be set up like the other sessions, students wouldn't be able to share their screens or talk. Are you wanting something like a lecture and demo each time. I'm trying to think how to fill the time, because setting these up and doing coding goes really fast.

Aside from that, I think I'll be able to handle it; the only concern would be the time. I know we went with 8pm EST to accomodate the international audience. Are we aiming for the same audience?

Hi James,

Thanks for these thoughtful questions — happy to clarify.

  1.  Dates & times

The specific dates and times are not fixed yet. We’re very open to adjusting the schedule based on your availability and what works best for you.

  2.  Course sequence & structure

The courses will run sequentially, starting with Level 1, followed by Level 2.

Within each level, we plan to split students into two groups (G7–8 and G9–11), as the depth and rigor of the content will differ between these age groups.

To move from Level 1 to Level 2, we will design a formal assessment to ensure students are ready for the next stage.

  3.  Instructional expectations & platform

We will use Google Classroom to distribute and collect all materials, assignments, datasets, and related resources.

All operational support (classroom setup, student management, materials distribution, etc.) will be handled on our end, so you can focus primarily on instruction and in-class guidance.

Best,
Bing

Bing,

Thank you for your message. A few questions:

What would be the days/times?

Would these run concurrently (i.e. Levels 1-2b going at the same time) or build starting with Level 1, then when that ends, move to Level 2, etc.?

What are the expectations on my part with regards to instrution? Will they have access to a learning platform with these materials and instructions already set up, or would I send them homework each week and then we discuss and troubleshoot on the day, or another arrangement?

Level 1 and Level 2a would be fairly easy to do without an LMS, but Level 2b would require at least Sharepointe or Google landing for the instructions, videos, datasets, etc.

Thoughts?

Hi James,

I hope you’re having a great weekend, and wish you a great holiday.

I’m happy to let you know that we are officially kicking off the AI Youth Research Series! We have started the enrollment process and finalized the content for the first two levels.

I have attached the syllabus for Level 1 and Level 2 for you to take a look at. We are planning for small classes of 5-6 students, with each session running for 2 hours. Regarding the rates, we can offer $150/session for Level 1 and $200/session for Level 2.

We would love to have you lead these courses. Do you have time this Spring to take these on?

Let me know your thoughts!

Best,
