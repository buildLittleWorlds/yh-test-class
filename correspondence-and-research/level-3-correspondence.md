**Subject:** Re: Level 3 Course -- Late February or Early March?

Hi Bing,

Thank you for sharing this detailed proposal. I've read through it carefully, and I want to say upfront: I find this genuinely exciting and see strong potential here.

**Why This Fits My Background**

The framing of this course aligns remarkably well with my experience. I've taught university courses in argumentation and philosophical debate for over 25 years, and I've been doing substantial work in applied AI over the past several years. The "PI/Lab Lead" role you describe — guiding research question refinement, evaluating methodological decisions, challenging assumptions, helping students articulate their reasoning — this is precisely what I do in my academic work. I have no concerns about this matching my skill set as an instructor.

**Why AI Is Well-Suited for This Domain**

From an intellectual perspective, current AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) are remarkably strong as debate partners, tutors, and coaches. These systems excel at:

- Analyzing argument structure and identifying logical gaps
- Generating counterarguments and anticipating opposing positions
- Providing feedback on clarity, organization, and rhetorical effectiveness
- Comparing student work against rubric criteria
- Offering Socratic-style coaching through dialogue

This isn't speculative — it's what these tools already do well. The research question you've framed ("How can AI systems support structured, fair, and effective feedback for student speech and debate performance?") is genuinely interesting and tractable. For high-achieving, serious students, investigating this question through modular research projects could be extremely valuable, both as AI education and as an introduction to research methodology.

**My Main Concern: The Audio/Video Delivery Component**

That said, the proposal is ambitious, and I want to flag one area that requires careful thought: the Speech Delivery Analysis module (prosodic features like pace, pauses, emphasis).

The content-focused modules — analyzing argument structure, comparing AI feedback to human judge feedback, generating practice recommendations — are very achievable with current LLM tools. Students can work with transcripts, prompts, and text-based evaluation frameworks without hitting major technical barriers.

However, if we're imagining AI analysis of audio or video delivery, that's a different level of technical complexity. Working with audio files, extracting prosodic features, and processing speech signals requires either:
- Significant technical skill with Python libraries and audio processing
- Or a lot of patience, troubleshooting, and time

This isn't impossible — tools like MyProsody and DisVoice exist for this purpose — but it would be a serious commitment from both the student and instructor. The debugging and technical problem-solving involved could easily consume substantial portions of our session time if we're not careful.

**How I'd Suggest We Approach This**

I don't see this concern as a reason not to proceed — rather, it's something we should acknowledge upfront as part of the challenge. A few possibilities:

1. **Scope the delivery module more narrowly**: Focus on transcript-based analysis (filler words, sentence length variation, pause markers in transcripts) rather than raw audio processing. This keeps it tractable while still addressing delivery.

2. **Make the technical difficulty explicit**: If a student chooses the prosodic analysis path, they understand from the start that wrestling with audio processing is part of the research challenge, not a bug in the course design.

3. **Steer toward the more accessible modules**: Three of the four modules you've proposed (content analysis, judge-style feedback, personalized recommendations) are highly achievable with LLM-based approaches. We could encourage most students toward these paths.

**Next Steps**

I'm genuinely interested in pursuing this. To move forward, it would help to discuss:

- **Data sources**: Where would the speech recordings, transcripts, and rubrics come from? Does Youth Horizons have existing materials, or would students work with public debate videos?
- **Student prerequisites**: What exposure have these Level 3 students had? Have they worked with Python/Colab in Levels 1-2?
- **Cohort composition**: How are students selected? Self-motivated, high-achieving students would thrive in this format; students needing more structure might struggle with the research autonomy.

I think there's real intellectual depth here, and with the right students and clear expectations about the technical challenges, this could be an exceptional course. I'd welcome a conversation to work through the details.

Best regards,
Dr. Plate

## 2026-01-25: Follow-up from Dr. Plate (Curriculum Development)

**Subject:** Re: Level 3 Course -- One Additional Note

Hi Bing,

One more thing I wanted to mention: over the last five years, curriculum development has been a significant focus of my work. I published a book with Routledge on composition and AI in composition classrooms — and composition, at its core, is argumentation and debate.

I noticed in your proposal that you're thinking about standardizing this Level 3 offering so it can be replicated for future cohorts. That kind of work — modularizing a course, making it scalable and repeatable — is something I find genuinely interesting and have experience with.

So beyond teaching the course itself, I'd be very interested in pursuing partnership work where we collaborate on developing and refining this program together. If that's something Youth Horizons would value, I'd welcome a conversation about what that could look like.

Best,
Dr. Plate
