I will plan on teaching the Level 2 students on my own on Saturday nights in 2-hour sessions for 12 weeks, starting whenever you indicate the students are ready.

I have been preparing the materials and the supporting Colab notebooks in line with the curriculum/syllabus that was shared earlier.

Do you know yet, Bing, what age group will be taking the Level 2 course with me? I can tailor the material appropriately.

Dan

That’s my understanding. Unless you want them at the same time, then we might have to do it sometime other than Saturday.

I do have a question, though.

My understanding is that James is doing the Level 1 teaching, and I'm doing Level 2. These are separate, correct?

I could be available on Saturday evenings if that is the best time.

At this stage, most students already have academically focused classes scheduled on weekday evenings. During the daytime on weekends, many of them are involved in sports training or competitions.

As a result, the most workable time slots tend to be Friday or Saturday evenings, which generally allow for the highest level of availability across students.

Please let me know if either of those evenings could work on your end, and we’d be happy to coordinate further.

Best regards,
Bing

Hello Dr. Hutson & Dr. Plate,

I hope you have been well. I wanted to share a brief update and ask for your thoughts regarding possible scheduling options for the upcoming AI course.

Over the past couple of weeks, we’ve been following up with several interested students and parents. Based on the feedback from this round, I’m wondering whether it might be possible to schedule the course on a weekend. A weekend option would make it significantly easier to coordinate availability across students, and we expect that it could allow more students to participate.

If weekends are not feasible, then later weekday evenings would likely work best. We have a number of students on the U.S. West Coast, and many of them only return home from school around 4:00 pm PT (6:00 pm CT). For that reason, ideal weekday time windows would be:

  *   6:30–8:30 pm CST, or

  *   7:00–9:00 pm CST

These time slots seem to balance schedules across different time zones reasonably well.

Thank you very much for your flexibility and for working with us on this. Please feel free to let me know what options might be realistic on your end, and we can continue coordinating from there.

Best regards,
Bing
