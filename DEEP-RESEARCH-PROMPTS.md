# Deep Research Prompts for Youth Horizons Curriculum

**Purpose:** Use these prompts with ChatGPT's Deep Research, Perplexity Deep Research, or similar tools to gather teaching materials for high-achieving 7th-11th grade students learning AI/ML.

**Target Audience Context:** These students don't know Python. They are curious, capable learners who want hands-on access to AI tools without the academic/professional ML pathway. They learn by doing, not by lectures.

2. Research on common misconceptions teenagers have about AI based on movies, games, and social media - and how teachers correct these

3. Hands-on activities that demonstrate the "input → model → output" concept without requiring code

4. Case studies of successful AI literacy programs for this age group (what worked, what didn't)

5. Age-appropriate ways to explain the difference between narrow AI and general AI that don't require technical background

Focus on sources from 2022-2026, prioritizing educational research, curriculum guides from organizations like AI4K12, and documented classroom experiences rather than theoretical frameworks.
```

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **For Deep Research tools:** Copy the entire prompt including context. These tools work best with detailed instructions about what you're looking for.

2. **Follow-up questions:** After initial results, ask for:
   - "More specific examples of classroom activities"
   - "Any research published after [year]"
   - "Sources from [specific organization like AI4K12, Code.org, etc.]"
   - "Student work samples or project examples"

3. **Cross-reference:** Run multiple prompts and look for overlapping recommendations - those are usually the most robust strategies.

4. **Adapt findings:** These prompts target the general middle/high school audience. Your specific cohort may need adjustments.
